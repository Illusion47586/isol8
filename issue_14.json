{"body":"## Priority\nMEDIUM-HIGH\n\n## Current Issue\nPool size is hardcoded to 2 (`src/engine/pool.ts:19`), which is insufficient for production deployments handling high concurrency.\n\n## Proposed Implementation\n```typescript\nexport interface PoolOptions {\n  docker: Docker;\n  poolSize?: number;  // Currently defaults to 2\n  createOptions: Omit<Docker.ContainerCreateOptions, \"Image\">;\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"pool\": {\n    \"size\": 10,  // Per-runtime pool size\n    \"maxTotal\": 50,  // Total containers across all runtimes\n    \"idleTimeout\": 300000  // Kill idle containers after 5min\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Variable\n```bash\nISOL8_POOL_SIZE=10 isol8 serve --port 3000\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- Support high-traffic production workloads\n- Tune for specific hardware (more RAM = bigger pool)\n- Different pool sizes for different runtimes\n- Reduce cold starts in burst scenarios\n\n## Metrics to Track\n- Pool hit rate by runtime\n- Average wait time for container\n- Memory usage by pool size\n- Cost vs performance tradeoff\n\n## Related Issues\n- Addresses #6 (race condition under burst load)\n- Complements #8 (quotas and rate limiting)\n\n## Recommendations\n- Default: 2 (current)\n- Development: 1-2\n- Production (low traffic): 5\n- Production (high traffic): 10-20\n- Enterprise: 50+\n","title":"[FEATURE] Configurable pool size"}
