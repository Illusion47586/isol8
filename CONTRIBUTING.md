# Contributing to isol8

Thank you for your interest in contributing to isol8! We welcome contributions from the community to make this project better.

## 🚨 Human Verification Required

We maintain a strict quality standard for this codebase. **All Pull Requests must be verified by a human.**

### What this means:
- If you use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate code, **you must manually review, test, and understand every line** before submitting.
- Drive-by PRs generated entirely by AI without human oversight will be rejected.
- You are responsible for the code you submit. "The AI wrote it" is not a valid excuse for bugs or security flaws.

## Active Participation

To ensure high-quality collaboration:
- **You must be active in the PR discussion threads.**
- We expect timely responses to code review feedback.
- If a PR is abandoned or the author is unresponsive to questions/feedback, it will be closed.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `bun install`.
3.  **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass with `bun test`.
4.  **Lint**: specialized linting rules are enforced. Run `bun run lint`.
5.  **Commit**: Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`).

## Pull Request Process

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
2.  Add tests for your changes.
3.  Update documentation (`README.md`, `SKILL.md`, `docs/`) to reflect your changes.
4.  Submit your PR with a clear description of the problem and solution.

We look forward to your contributions!
