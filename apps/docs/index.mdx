<Callout type="info">
  **Migration**: CLI is now `@isol8/cli` (installed as `isol8` command), library is `@isol8/core`.
</Callout>

isol8 is a secure code execution engine for untrusted code.

<Info>
  If you are new to isol8, follow `Quickstart` first, then read `Execution guide` before tuning configuration or performance.
</Info>

## Why this matters

isol8 is built around three priorities that matter in real usage:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Speed" icon="gauge">
    Warm container pools reduce startup overhead; current warm-pool median TTI is about `0.12s-0.15s` across runtimes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety" icon="shield-check">
    Code runs in isolated containers with strict limits, network controls, and output sanitization by default.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplicity" icon="sparkles">
    Start with a single command, then layer on advanced controls only when you need them.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  isol8 can be as simple as you want and as complex as you need.

## Core features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-runtime isolation" icon="box" href="/runtimes">
    Execute Python, Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Bash code inside isolated Docker sandboxes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execution modes" icon="repeat" href="/persistence">
    Use ephemeral runs for clean isolation or persistent sessions when you need stateful workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm container pools" icon="zap" href="/performance">
    Choose pool strategies (`fast`, `secure`) to reduce startup overhead while preserving controls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network controls" icon="shield-check" href="/security">
    Enforce filtered networking with proxy rules plus iptables restrictions to prevent bypass.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remote server + client" icon="server" href="/remote">
    Run isol8 as an HTTP service with streaming execution and session/file APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit + observability" icon="chart-line" href="/observability">
    Capture resource and audit logs for visibility, compliance, and incident analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource guardrails" icon="timer" href="/execution">
    Enforce timeouts, memory limits, CPU limits, and process caps for predictable execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secrets + output safety" icon="shield" href="/security">
    Mask sensitive values in output and cap output volume to reduce leak and overload risk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Package installation" icon="box" href="/packages">
    Install runtime-specific dependencies per execution without managing long-lived environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI + library + API" icon="terminal" href="/option-mapping">
    Use the same engine through commands, TypeScript APIs, or remote HTTP endpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verified remote code" icon="file-check" href="/remote-code">
    Fetch code from URLs/GitHub/Gists with policy controls and optional hash verification.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Speed and performance

isol8 is designed for low-friction execution loops:

- Warm pools reduce container startup overhead for repeated executions.
- Pool strategies let you choose between maximum throughput (`fast`) and stronger cleanup guarantees (`secure`).
- Setup is idempotent, so image preparation can be safely reused across local runs and CI jobs.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Where should I start if I only need local execution?">
  Start with <a href="/quickstart">Quickstart</a>, then move to <a href="/cli">How to CLI</a> for flag-level details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I read Execution vs Option mapping?">
  Read <a href="/execution">Execution guide</a> for behavior and lifecycle. Read <a href="/option-mapping">Option mapping</a> to map each option to CLI, config, API, and library inputs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where are remote server endpoint examples?">
  Use <a href="/remote">Remote server and client</a> for endpoint usage patterns and request examples.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting quick checks

- **Unsure which page to use**: start from `Quickstart`, then follow the “Next steps” cards on each page.
- **Command works differently than expected**: verify where the value is set in <a href="/option-mapping">Option mapping</a>.
- **Execution failures**: use <a href="/troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for symptom-based fixes.
