When code execution doesn't produce the expected results, isol8 provides two flags for diagnosing issues: `--persist` (keep the container alive for inspection) and `--debug` (enable internal engine logging).

## Using `--persist` to Inspect Containers

By default, containers are cleaned up after execution. Use `--persist` to keep the container running so you can inspect its state:

```bash
# Run with --persist to keep the container alive
isol8 run -e "
import json
data = {'key': 'value'}
with open('/sandbox/output.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
print('Done')
" --runtime python --persist
```

After execution, the container is still running. Find it with Docker and inspect:

```bash
# List running isol8 containers
docker ps --filter "ancestor=isol8:python"

# Exec into the container to inspect files
docker exec -it <container-id> sh
ls -la /sandbox/
cat /sandbox/output.json

# Check environment variables
docker exec <container-id> env

# Check running processes
docker exec <container-id> ps aux
```

## Using `--debug` to See Engine Internals

`--debug` prints internal engine logs that are normally silent:

```bash
isol8 run -e "print('hello')" --runtime python --debug
```

This outputs `[DEBUG]` prefixed messages about:
- Container pool operations (acquiring/releasing warm containers)
- Container lifecycle (create, start, stop, remove)
- Persist/cleanup decisions
- Image resolution

Example debug output:
```
[DEBUG] Acquiring container from pool for image isol8:python
[DEBUG] Pool hit: reusing warm container abc123
[DEBUG] Executing code in container abc123
[DEBUG] Execution completed in 52ms
[DEBUG] Releasing container abc123 back to pool
[DEBUG] Container /sandbox wiped and returned to pool
hello
```

## Combining Both Flags

Use both `--persist` and `--debug` for maximum visibility:

```bash
isol8 run -e "print('hello')" --runtime python --persist --debug
```

This shows you the internal decisions **and** keeps the container alive for inspection. The debug output will show that the container was **not** returned to the pool:

```
[DEBUG] Acquiring container from pool for image isol8:python
[DEBUG] Pool hit: reusing warm container abc123
[DEBUG] Executing code in container abc123
[DEBUG] Execution completed in 52ms
[DEBUG] Persist enabled — container abc123 NOT returned to pool
hello
```

## Library Usage

```typescript
import { DockerIsol8 } from "isol8";

const isol8 = new DockerIsol8({
  mode: "ephemeral",
  persist: true,    // Keep container after execution
  debug: true,      // Print internal logs
});

await isol8.start();

const result = await isol8.execute({
  code: 'print("debugging!")',
  runtime: "python",
});

// Container is still running — inspect it with Docker CLI
console.log("Container ID:", result.containerId);

// Don't forget to clean up manually later:
// docker rm -f <container-id>
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Timeout Errors

```
EXECUTION TIMED OUT
```

The code exceeded the timeout limit. Increase it:

```bash
isol8 run script.py --timeout 60000   # 60 seconds
```

For debugging, use `--persist` to see how far the code got:

```bash
isol8 run script.py --timeout 60000 --persist
# Then inspect /sandbox/ in the container
```

### Out of Memory

```
Killed
```

The container hit the memory limit and was OOM-killed. Increase memory:

```bash
isol8 run script.py --memory 2g
```

### No Space Left on Device

```
OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device
```

The `/sandbox` or `/tmp` tmpfs is full. Increase the size:

```bash
isol8 run script.py --sandbox-size 1g --tmp-size 512m
```

### Package Installation Failures

```
Operation not permitted
```

Native packages (numpy, pandas) need execution permission on the install directory. isol8 installs to `/sandbox` which has `exec`, but the sandbox may be too small:

```bash
isol8 run -e "import numpy" --runtime python --install numpy --sandbox-size 1g
```

### Runtime Mismatch in Persistent Mode

```
Error: Cannot switch runtime from "python" to "node"
```

Persistent containers are locked to one runtime. Create separate instances:

```typescript
const pythonEngine = new DockerIsol8({ mode: "persistent" });
const nodeEngine = new DockerIsol8({ mode: "persistent" });
```

### Debugging Network Issues

For `filtered` mode connectivity problems, use `--debug` to see proxy logs and test with curl:

```bash
# Test what's reachable
isol8 run -e "
import urllib.request
try:
    resp = urllib.request.urlopen('https://api.github.com')
    print(f'OK: {resp.status}')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Blocked: {e}')
" --runtime python --net filtered --allow "^api\.github\.com$" --debug
```

## Cleanup After Debugging

After using `--persist`, clean up leftover containers:

```bash
# Remove all isol8 containers
isol8 cleanup

# Or force without confirmation
isol8 cleanup --force
```

Programmatically:

```typescript
const result = await DockerIsol8.cleanup();
console.log(`Removed ${result.removed} containers`);
```
