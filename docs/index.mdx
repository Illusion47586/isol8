isol8 is a secure code execution engine for untrusted code.

<Info>
  If you are new to isol8, follow `Quickstart` first, then read `Execution guide` before tuning configuration or performance.
</Info>

Core capabilities:

- Isolated Docker execution for Python, Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Bash
- Ephemeral and persistent modes
- Warm pool strategies (`fast`, `secure`)
- Filtered networking with proxy + iptables enforcement
- Remote HTTP server with streaming and session/file APIs
- Audit and resource logging options

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Where should I start if I only need local execution?">
  Start with <a href="/quickstart">Quickstart</a>, then move to <a href="/cli">How to CLI</a> for flag-level details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I read Execution vs Option mapping?">
  Read <a href="/execution">Execution guide</a> for behavior and lifecycle. Read <a href="/option-mapping">Option mapping</a> to map each option to CLI, config, API, and library inputs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where are remote server endpoint examples?">
  Use <a href="/remote">Remote server and client</a> for endpoint usage patterns and request examples.

## Troubleshooting quick checks

- **Unsure which page to use**: start from `Quickstart`, then follow the “Next steps” cards on each page.
- **Command works differently than expected**: verify where the value is set in <a href="/option-mapping">Option mapping</a>.
- **Execution failures**: use <a href="/troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for symptom-based fixes.
