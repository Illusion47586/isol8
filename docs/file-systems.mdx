When executing untrusted code, restricting what the code can read from and write to the file system is a critical defense layer. `isol8` provisions a highly isolated file system environment for every execution. 

By default, the container's root file system is immutable (read-only), while specific temporary directories are mounted as ephemeral, memory-backed filesystems (`tmpfs`).

## Read-Only Root

By default, the execution environment operates with a read-only root file system (`readonlyRootFs: true`). This security best practice ensures that malicious or buggy code cannot modify system binaries, configuration files, or the underlying runtime environment.

Any attempt to write outside of the designated `tmpfs` mounts will result in an immediate `"Read-only file system"` error from the OS.

### Making the File System Writable

In certain use cases (e.g., legacy workloads or specific compilation tasks), you might need a globally writable file system. You can disable the read-only restriction, but this is **highly discouraged** for untrusted code execution.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Use the `--writable` flag to make the root file system writable.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Command
    isol8 execute python --code "open('/writable.txt', 'w').write('test')" --writable
    ```
    ```text Expected behavior
    The script successfully creates /writable.txt in the container root without throwing a read-only error.
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Library">
    Set `readonlyRootFs: false` in your configuration.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Input
    import { Isol8 } from 'isol8';

    const engine = new Isol8();
    await engine.execute({
      runtime: 'python',
      code: "open('/writable.txt', 'w').write('test')",
      readonlyRootFs: false
    });
    ```
    ```text Expected behavior
    The script successfully creates /writable.txt in the container root without throwing a read-only error.
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Disabling `readonlyRootFs` decreases the security posture of your sandbox. Combined with poor configuration, it could potentially aid in container escape methodologies. Always evaluate if writing to `/sandbox` or `/tmp` is sufficient for your workload.
</Warning>

## Tmpfs Mounts

Even with a read-only root, agents and scripts often need temporary space to write intermediate files, download assets, or compile extensions. `isol8` solves this by mounting specific directories as `tmpfs` volumes.

A `tmpfs` mount resides entirely in host RAM (or swap space) rather than on disk. This provides two major benefits:
1. **Speed**: File I/O operations in these directories are significantly faster than disk-backed storage.
2. **Ephemeral Guarantees**: When the container is destroyed, the contents of the `tmpfs` mounts vanish instantly. There is zero risk of data persistence across executions.

`isol8` provisions two default `tmpfs` mounts:

### `/sandbox`

The `/sandbox` directory is the default working directory (`cwd`) for all code executed in `isol8`. This is where you should write any generated artifacts, logs, or intermediate state.
- **Default Size**: `512m` (512 Megabytes)
- **Usage**: General scratchpad, `cwd` for execution, and the destination for packages installed via the `--install` flag.

### `/tmp`

The standard `/tmp` directory is also mounted as an independent `tmpfs` volume. This ensures compatibility with runtimes and tools that hardcode `/tmp` for their operations.
- **Default Size**: `256m` (256 Megabytes)
- **Usage**: System temp files, runtime cache.

### Configuring Tmpfs Sizes

You can adjust the maximum size of these mounts depending on your workload's memory requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Library">
    Use the `sandboxFsSize` and `tmpFsSize` properties in your execution configuration to allocate more or less space.
    ```typescript
    await engine.execute({
      runtime: 'python',
      code: "...",
      sandboxFsSize: '1g', // Allow up to 1GB in /sandbox
      tmpFsSize: '512m'    // Allow up to 512MB in /tmp
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Because `tmpfs` mounts consume the host's memory, setting exceedingly large limits without enforcing corresponding container RAM constraints could lead to host memory exhaustion. Ensure your overall `memory` limit accounts for the expected `tmpfs` usage.
</Note>

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Can I persist data written to the read-only root?">
  No. Even with `--writable`, any changes written directly to the root file system are lost when the container is destroyed. Use the `/sandbox` tmpfs mount and output files if you need to retrieve generated files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does tmpFsSize limit the physical disk space used?">
  No, `tmpfs` mounts reside entirely in memory. The size limits dictate the maximum RAM that the filesystem can consume. Ensure your overall execution `memory` limit accounts for this.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting quick checks

- **`OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system`**: You attempted to write to a path outside of `/sandbox` or `/tmp`. Adjust your code to write to `/sandbox`, or use `--writable` (not recommended).
- **Out of memory or process killed during heavy file I/O**: You might be writing too much data to a `tmpfs` mount, exhausting the container's RAM. Increase `/sandbox` or `/tmp` size limits and increase the overall container `memory`.
