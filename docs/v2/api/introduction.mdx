The isol8 server exposes a REST API for remote code execution, streaming, and file management.

## Base URL

By default, the server listens on port 3000.

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `GET /health`) require a Bearer token. This token corresponds to the API key configured when starting the server.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## Response Format

All responses are JSON.

- **Success**: HTTP 2xx codes.
- **Errors**: HTTP 4xx/5xx codes with an `error` field in the body.

```json
{
  "error": "Session not found"
}
```

## Server-Only Features

Unlike the ephemeral CLI, the server is a long-running process that provides centralized management capabilities.

### 1. Global Concurrency Control
The server enforces a **global limit** on parallel executions across *all* connected clients.
- Controlled by `maxConcurrent` in config (default: 10).
- Requests exceeding the limit are queued automatically.
- This protects the host machine from resource exhaustion during traffic spikes.

### 2. Automatic Session Pruning
The server runs a background task to clean up abandoned persistent sessions.
- **Interval**: Checks every 60 seconds.
- **Policy**: Removes sessions that have been idle for more than 1 hour (configurable via `cleanup.maxContainerAgeMs`).
- **Benefit**: Prevents memory leaks from clients that forget to call `DELETE /session`.

### 3. Centralized Configuration
Server-side defaults in `isol8.config.json` are automatically merged into every incoming request.
- **Baseline Security**: Enforce `network: "none"` or memory limits globally.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all clients use the same seccomp profiles and timeouts.
- **Overrides**: Clients can override specific settings in the `options` body if needed.

### 4. Health Monitoring
The `GET /health` endpoint allows load balancers (AWS ALB, Nginx) and monitoring tools (Datadog, Prometheus) to verify the engine is responsive without authentication.
