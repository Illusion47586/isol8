The isol8 server exposes a REST API for remote code execution, streaming, and file management.

## Base URL

By default, the server listens on port 3000.

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `GET /health`) require a Bearer token. This token corresponds to the API key configured when starting the server.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## Response Format

All responses are JSON.

- **Success**: HTTP 2xx codes.
- **Errors**: HTTP 4xx/5xx codes with an `error` field in the body.

```json
{
  "error": "Session not found"
}
```
