---

isol8 is a secure code execution engine designed specifically for AI agents and LLMs. It runs untrusted code inside Docker containers with strict resource limits, network controls, and output sanitization.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-Runtime Support" icon="code" href="/v2/execution">
    Execute Python, Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Bash out of the box. Each runtime has its own optimized Docker image.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Container Isolation" icon="shield" href="/v2/security">
    Every execution runs in a Docker container with read-only root filesystem, PID limits, memory/CPU caps, and `no-new-privileges`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Control" icon="globe" href="/v2/security#network-control">
    Choose between `none` (blocked), `host` (full access), or `filtered` (HTTP/HTTPS proxy with whitelist/blacklist).

    Stream stdout and stderr as code executes via library or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Why isol8?

Building reliable code execution for AI agents is hard. You need to handle security, timeouts, resource exhaustion, and dependency management. isol8 solves these problems with a battle-hardened engine that provides:

- **Sub-150ms Latency**: A warm container pool keeps pre-started containers ready for immediate use.
- **Secret Masking**: Automatically masks sensitive values in stdout/stderr to prevent leakage.
- **File I/O**: Inject input files and retrieve output files easily.
- **Package Management**: Install packages on the fly or bake them into custom images.
