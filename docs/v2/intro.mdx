Give your AI agents the power to write and run code without risking your infrastructure. **isol8** provides a secure, ephemeral, and high-performance environment designed specifically for untrusted code execution by LLMs.

## Designed for Agents

isol8 is built to be the "Code Interpreter" for your custom agents. It handles the complexity of sandboxing so you can focus on reasoning.

```typescript
// Example: An agent tool for executing code
import { DockerIsol8 } from "isol8";

const sandbox = new DockerIsol8({
  mode: "ephemeral",
  network: "filtered", // Allow only specific APIs
  timeoutMs: 30000,
});

async function executeTool(code: string) {
  const result = await sandbox.execute({
    code,
    runtime: "python",
    installPackages: ["pandas", "requests"], // Install on the fly
  });

  return result.stdout; // Safe to return to the LLM
}
```

## Why isol8?

Building reliable code execution for AI is hard. You need to handle security break-outs, infinite loops, resource exhaustion, and dependency management. isol8 solves these problems with a battle-hardened engine:

- **Security First**: Every run happens in a fresh, isolated Docker container.
- **Dependency Management**: Install packages on the fly or bake them into custom images.
- **File I/O**: Easily inject datasets and retrieve generated charts or files.
- **Observability**: Full audit logs for compliance and debugging.
