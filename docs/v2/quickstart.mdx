Ready to execute code safely? This guide will walk you through installing isol8, setting up the environment, and running your first sandboxed code.

## Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Must be installed and running.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** (recommended) or **Node.js 18+**.

## Installation

Install the CLI globally to use `isol8` from anywhere:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install -g isol8
```

```bash bun
bun install -g isol8
```
</CodeGroup>

Or add it to your project:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install isol8
```

```bash bun
bun add isol8
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup

Before running code, you need to build the Docker images. This command verifies your Docker connection and builds the optimized runtime images.

```bash
isol8 setup
```

<Check>
  This step is only needed once (or when you want to update images). It builds `isol8:python`, `isol8:node`, `isol8:bun`, `isol8:deno`, and `isol8:bash`.
</Check>

## Hello World

Run your first snippet of code securely. The `--eval` flag lets you pass code directly.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
isol8 run -e "print('Hello form the sandbox!')" --runtime python
```

```bash Node.js
isol8 run -e "console.log('Hello from Node!')" --runtime node
```

```bash Bun
isol8 run -e "console.log('Hello from Bun!')" --runtime bun
```

```bash Bash
isol8 run -e "echo 'Hello from Bash!'" --runtime bash
```
</CodeGroup>

## Feature Highlights

Now that you have it running, explore what isol8 can do:

### 1. Install Packages on the Fly

Need `numpy`? Just ask for it. isol8 installs it in the container before running your code.

```bash
isol8 run -e "import numpy; print(numpy.array([1, 2, 3]))" 
  --runtime python --install numpy
```

### 2. Stream Output in Real-Time

Don't wait for the process to finish. Stream stdout and stderr as they happen.

```bash
isol8 run -e "import time; print('Start'); time.sleep(1); print('End')" 
  --runtime python --stream
```

### 3. Use Network Filters

Need to call an API? Use `filtered` mode to allow only specific domains.

```bash
isol8 run script.py --net filtered --allow "^api\.openai\.com$"
```

### 4. Persist State

Keep variables and files between executions using persistent mode.

```bash
# Set a variable
isol8 run --persistent -e "x = 42" --runtime python

# Read it back in a new execution
isol8 run --persistent -e "print(x)" --runtime python
```
